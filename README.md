## Description

"This project, developed as part of my course at CEI, stems from my desire to support my mother, a nutritionist. My goal was to create a comprehensive program that would streamline patient management from the moment they enter the consultation room until they receive their personalized treatment. This marks my first significant project in Python, where I aimed to merge my knowledge with a passion for programming to contribute to the field of nutrition. The program aims to streamline the care process by offering tools to record personal data, nutritional details, preferences, and food allergies, with the ability to provide personalized diets and advice tailored to individual needs. I aspire for this project to benefit not only my mother in her professional practice but also other nutrition professionals in optimizing their services."
